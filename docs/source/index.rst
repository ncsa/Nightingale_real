.. important::

    This page will become the official user-facing documentation for the NCSA Nightingale system when the (currently official) wiki documentation gets migrated.  Until then, this page is just a test page for the new documentation system.  The transition date when this becomes official is sometime in the future, but we hope it happens in August 2022.  This message will be changed to reflect the transition date as soon as it has been agreed upon and set.  (Status as of August 11, 2022)

.. warning::

   There will be a preventative maintenance period all day on August 17 on Nightingale.  All systems will be effected and users will not be able to log in.  The system should be restored to functionality by the evening.  If the system will not be up then, this note will be revised.

NCSA Nightingale Documentation
=========================================================

The **Nightingale Cluster** is a high-performance environment within the Advanced Computational Health Enclave (ACHE). The ACHE is a unique environment with restricted physical and electronic access. All electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) processed or stored at NCSA is done within this environment. The Nightingale Cluster system seeks to expand the ACHE to provide a multi-tenant campus cluster-like environment to meet the needs of researchers who wish to process and store ePHI.
