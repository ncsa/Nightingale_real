Protected Data
==============

Data stored on Nightingale may contain sensitive, regulated information. While Nightingale is set up to protect this data, users (you) are directly responsible for protecting it. 

All downloads (transferring data *off* of Nightingale) are monitored and will be investigated. If you need to download results from Nightingale that don't contain sensitive data, :ref:`submit a support request <help>` detailing what data you need to download, why you need it, and how you intend to download it. Please do this at least one business day **before** you start downloading, or you are likely to get emails from the admin team asking what you are doing.  

All user data on Nightingale is stored in directories that have group permissions set so that members of that group can read the data, but no other users on the system can read it. You should not attempt to read data belonging to groups you are not a member of. If you discover that you have access to user data from a group you are not a member of (or a group you are not supposed to be a member of) please notify us **immediately** via a :ref:`support request <help>`.  

Most Principal Investigators (PIs) and individual non-PI users will only be a member of one group. However, in the case that you are a member of multiple groups on Nightingale, understand that you have a separate responsibility to each group to safeguard its data. There are system checks to detect copying user data from an area owned by one group to an area owned by a different group. If you are not a PI, just don't do this. If you are a PI of multiple groups on Nightingale and have a legitimate reason to copy data from one group to another, please :ref:`submit a support request <help>` at least one business day **before** moving any data. Moving files will set off security alerts, so please let us know in advance.
