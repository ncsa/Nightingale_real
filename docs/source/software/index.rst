.. note::
   You are allowed to install software in spaces you have access to (home, project)
   When installing any software you should consider the following:

   - Home directory disk usage quotas.
   - Will the software be used by multiple users in my group?
     (Project space is the **recommended** location to install software.)
   - Does the desired software have dependencies/requirements?
   - Is the prerequisite software already installed?
