Status Updates and Notices
=============================

There are three *scheduled* system maintenance periods every year in January, May, and August. Other *unscheduled*, emergency downtimes may occur for important system software security updates or due to a hardware failure. Nightingale users are notified of upcoming system maintenance through:

- Email
- Message of the Day when you log into the system
- `NCSA status page <https://status.ncsa.illinois.edu>`_ (can also be used to monitor current status of maintenance)

If you have any questions about upcoming maintenance or maintenance notifications, please submit a support request (:ref:`help`).
