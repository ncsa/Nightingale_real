Getting an Account
====================

To access Nightingale, your project needs to have a project group on the machine, you must get an NCSA Identity 
(username and password), and request access from Nightingale administrators. 
Once approved, you will be given instructions on how to be added to NCSA's HIPAA Covered Entity. 
The steps below explain this process.

Create an NCSA Identity
----------------------------

Before requesting Nightingale access, you need an NCSA identity. You can skip this step if you already have an NCSA identity. 
If you donâ€™t remember your password, you can reset it on the `NCSA Identity and Access Management webpage <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_.

- **To create an NCSA identity**, go to this `invite link <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity>`_

**Note:** In addition to creating a new account, this process will automatically enroll you into NCSA's Duo multi-factor 
authentication (https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa), which is required to log into Nightingale. (This is not the same as the University of Illnois's Duo.)

Request Project Group
----------------------------

If your project hasn't been added to Nightingale yet, your PI needs to make a request for a project to be created for it. Once the form is completed they should get a response in a couple of days.

- **To create a project group**, use this form `(authenticating with your NCSA identity) <https://xras-submit.ncsa.illinois.edu/opportunities/531957/requests/new>`_

Someone from the Nightingale project will contact you via email within a few days of filling out this form.  They will begin the process.  You will then receive emails pointing you to things like: 

- Taking training appropriate for your project
- Becoming part of the NCSA HIPAA Covered Entity
- Having your project group created

After that happens, you (or your PI) will need to create your login account attached to your project group, and then you'll have access to Nightingale.
