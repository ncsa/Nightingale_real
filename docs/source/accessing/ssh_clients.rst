SSH Clients
===========

Several SSH-based clients are available for accessing Nightingale. Which one you use depends on your workstationâ€™s operating 
system. These are described in the sections below.

**Microsoft Windows**

You can use the built-in SSH Client in Windows (version 10 and above) or select from several freely available third-party SSH 
clients when using the Microsoft Windows operating system. These typically provide a Graphical User Interface rather than a 
command-line interface. `PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ is a popular choice, and
`MobaXterm <http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`_ is another one.

**Mac OS X**

Mac OS X comes with a built-in open-source version of SSH called OpenSSH. You can access it via the Terminal application. 
`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ is also available for Mac OS X.

**Linux**

The Linux operating system has SSH built into it. You use the Linux terminal application to connect via SSH. 
`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ is also available for Linux.
