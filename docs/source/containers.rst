Containers
==========

Because of the limitations of Nightingale nodes to access the external sites due to its increased security restrictions, containers are not generally supported on Nightingale. However, they may be used in limited use cases. If you need to use containers, please submit a ticket to Nightingale user support staff by emailing help@ncsa.illinois.edu, and we will talk to you about your options.
