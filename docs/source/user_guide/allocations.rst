Getting an Account
=====================

To access Nightingale, a project needs to have a *project group* (allocation) set up on the system. 
You must be the project's **Principal Investigator (PI)** to set up the project group.

If you are not a project PI and want to be added to an existing Nightingale project group, jump to :ref:`get-added`.

How to Get a Project Group (Allocation) - PIs
--------------------------------------------------

As the PI, your user login account will be the first login account attached to the project group on Nightingale. You will need to follow the process of creating the project group, go through the training process, and be added to the HIPAA Covered Entity. Other users on the project will just need to follow the training and Covered Entity process.

Create an NCSA Identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you request a project group on Nightingale, you must have an NCSA Identity. 

To create an NCSA identity, go to this `Nightingale invite <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity>`_ and click **Register New User and Join**.  
This process will also automatically enroll you in `NCSA's Duo multi-factor authentication <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa>`_, which is required to log in to Nightingale. This is separate from the University of Illinois Duo. 

.. note::
   When you enroll in NCSA Duo, it is important to create and save two backup codes to use in case you lose your Duo device.  
   
If you already have an NCSA identity but don't remember your password, you can reset it on the `NCSA Identity and Access Management webpage <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_.

Discuss Your Project with Nightingale Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before your project group is created on Nightingale, you need to discuss your project, its needs, your expectations, and what Nightingale access can get you. 

To begin that conversation, please fill out and the `NCSA XRAS form <https://xras-submit.ncsa.illinois.edu/opportunities/531957/requests/new>`_. (Log in with your NCSA identity username and password.) 

Someone from the Nightingale project will contact you via email within a few days of submitting this form and begin the process of creating your project group.  

After your Project Group is Created
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After your project group is created, Nightingale administrators will create your data storage directories and project group name. You will find out about these steps via email. In the informational email, your group will be assigned an *interactive node* (shared or exclusive) to log in to and/or if you have batch system access, you will be assigned a *charge account* to assign your jobs to.  

Getting a User Login Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get a user login account to access the Nightingale system, *you* are responsible for:

  - Becoming part of the NCSA HIPAA Covered Entity. This will involve taking training specific to the type of data that you will be handling on Nightingale. You may need to submit your training certificate to a web form to become part of the covered entity.

  - Making sure all devices that you will log in to Nightingale from have an encrypted hard drive.
