Allocation Adminstration
==========================

Getting a Project Group (Allocation)
---------------------------------------

To access Nightingale, your project needs to have a *project group* set up with access to Nightingale and associated with the various resources that you need to use. 
The project's **Principal Investigator (PI)** sets up the project group, and the PI's user login account will be the first login account attached to the project group. 

The project PI will need to follow the process of creating the project group, and themselves go through the training process and be added to the HIPAA Covered Entity. Other users on the project will just need to follow the training and Covered Entity process. This page covers both processes.

      **Create an NCSA Identity**

      Before you request a Nightingale project group on Nightingale, you must have an NCSA Identity. 

      To create an NCSA identity, go to this `Nightingale invite link <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity>`_ and click **Register New User and Join**.  
      In addition to creating a new account, this process will automatically enroll you into `NCSA's Duo multi-factor authentication <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa>`_, which is required to log in to Nightingale. **This is not the same as the University of Illinois Duo**. 

      .. note::
         When you enroll in NCSA Duo, it is very important to create and save two backup codes to use in case you lose your Duo device.  


      If you already have an NCSA identity but don't remember your password, you can reset it on the `NCSA Identity and Access Management webpage <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_.

      **Discuss Your Project with Nightingale Management**

      Before your project group is created on Nightingale, you need to discuss your project, its needs, your expectations, and what Nightingale access can get you. 

      To begin that conversation, please fill out and the `NCSA XRAS form <https://xras-submit.ncsa.illinois.edu/opportunities/531957/requests/new>`_. (Log in with your NCSA identity username and password.) Someone from the Nightingale project will contact you via email within a few days of submitting this form and begin the process of creating your project group.  

      **What Happens After your Project Group is Created**      

      After your project group is created, Nightingale administrators will create your data storage directories and project group name. You will find out about these steps via email. In the informational email, your group will be assigned an *interactive node* (shared or exclusive) to log in to and/or if you have batch system access, you will be assigned a *charge account* to assign your jobs to.  

      **Being Added to Nightingale Access**

      To get a user login account to access the Nightingale system, *you* are responsible for:

        - Becoming part of the NCSA HIPAA Covered Entity. This will involve taking training specific to the type of data that you will be handling on Nightingale. You may need to submit your training certificate to a web form to become part of the covered entity.

        \

        - Making sure all devices that you will log in to Nightingale from have an encrypted hard drive.

Account Administration
