On Nightingale there is an approval process for adding users to the system. To start the process, contact `help@ncsa.illinois.edu <mailto:help@ncsa.illinois.edu>`_.

Other account and project administration tasks, such as resetting your password, are 
managed by the NCSA Identity and Group Management tools. Please see the 
`NCSA Allocation and Account Management documentation page <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/USSPPRT/NCSA+Allocation+and+Account+Management>`_ for more information.
