Setting Up Your Account
==============================================

The steps below explain how to request Nightingale access and start
using the cluster.

**1. Create an NCSA Identity**
-------------------------------

Before requesting Nightingale access, you need an NCSA identity. You can skip this step if you already have an NCSA identity. If you don’t remember your password, you can reset it by using this link:* https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/.

     To create an NCSA identity, go to this invite link: https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity.

**Note:** In addition to creating a new account, this process will automatically enroll you into NCSA's Duo multi-factor authentication (https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa) which is required to log into Nightingale.

**2. Request Nightingale Access**
---------------------------------

     To request Nightingale access, send an email to Once you have an NCSA identity, email a request for a login account for Nightingale to  `help+hipaa@ncsa.illinois.edu <mailto:help+hipaa@ncsa.illinois.edu>`_ that includes your NCSA identity, your University UIN, and a brief description of why you want the access. If you completed some type of Regulated Sensitive Data training less than a year ago (HIPPA or otherwise), please attach your training certificate.

**3. Get Added to NCSA's HIPPA Covered Entity**
-----------------------------------------------

The University of Illinois’ HIPAA Privacy and Security Directive requires that all members of a covered component complete HIPAA training on an annual basis and perform endpoint disk encryption of portable devices (like laptops) used to access, process or store HIPAA regulated sensitive data. Your email request in Step 2 starts the process of getting added to NCSA's HIPAA Covered Entity required to access Nightingale.

     To get added to NCSA's HIPPA Covered Entity, follow the instructions in the response to the email you sent in Step 2. These instructions will include information on how to:

     - access the HIPAA training and submit your completion certificate
     - perform the disk encryption (NCSA personnel will guide you through this process)

     Note: You may request an exemption from the encryption requirement in cases such as if you plan to use an on-site work desktop.
