<p style="">The steps below explain how to request Nightingale access and start using the cluster.&nbsp;</p>
<ol style="">
<li>Creating NCSA Identity
<ul>
<li>Before requesting Nightingale access, you need to have an NCSA identity.&nbsp; You can generate your NCSA identity by using this invite link:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity" class="external-link" style="">https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity</a>.</li>
<li>In addition to creating a new account, this process will automatically enroll you into NCSA's Duo multi-factor authentication (<a style="" href="https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa" class="external-link">https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa</a>) which is required to log into Nightingale.</li>
<li>You can skip this step if you already have an NCSA identity. If you don&rsquo;t remember your password, you can reset it by using this link:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/" class="external-link" style="">https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/</a>.</li>
<li><strong>VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> You should always have <strong>TWO backup Duo tokens</strong> (these are 8-digit numbers that you write down manually and store somewhere OTHER THAN ON YOUR PHONE).&nbsp; You can use these codes to verify your identity in case you upgrade your phone without the ability to get a duo code from your old phone, or perhaps lose your phone.&nbsp; If you don't have two codes written down somewhere you can get at them, please use the Duo system to generate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li>
<li>Requesting Nightingale Access
<ul>
<li>To request Nightingale access, send an email to Maria Jaromin at<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="external-link" href="mailto:mjaromin@illinois.edu" style="">mjaromin@illinois.edu</a>.&nbsp; The request should include your NCSA username, your University UIN, and a brief justification why you need the access.</li>
<li>If you completed the University of Illinois&rsquo; HIPAA privacy and security training less than a year ago, please attach your training certificate. &nbsp;</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/ACHE/HIPAA+Tools%3A+Adding+a+HIPAA+Covered+Entity" style="">Getting Added to NCSA Covered Entity</a>
<ul>
<li>The email request in Step 2 starts the process of adding you to NCSA's &quot;HIPAA Covered Entity&quot;.&nbsp; The University of Illinois&rsquo; HIPAA Privacy and Security Directive requires that all members of a covered component complete the HIPAA training on an annual basis <em>and perform endpoint disk encryption of portable devices (like laptops) used to access, process or store ePHI.</em>
<ol>
<li>HIPAA training
<ol>
<li>University of Illinois currently uses the<span>&nbsp;</span><a style="" href="https://training.knowbe4.com/auth/saml/ef047fafa8535" class="external-link">KnowBe4</a><span>&nbsp;</span>platform to deploy the HIPAA training. You will be added to the training and will receive an email with instructions on access the platform.</li>
<li>After completing the training, you need to upload the training certificate to<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://internal.ncsa.illinois.edu/mis/hipaa/training/index.php?page=main&amp;" style="" class="external-link">HIPAA Tools</a><span>&nbsp;</span>in Savannah.

<li>If you plan to use an on-site work desktop, you can request an exemption from the encryption requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol></li></ul></li></ol>
