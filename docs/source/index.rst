.. important::

   This page will be the new location for the NCSA Nightingale documentation, as opposed to the Confluence wiki.  This page is NOT official until this notice disappears.  Until that time, we're testing the migration and deployment.  As of August 9, 2022, this is NOT YET the official documentation page.  Anything here may be out of date or preliminary, or just a meaningless test page.

   Short-term status notes will be posted here.

NCSA Nightingale Documentation
=========================================================

The **Nightingale Cluster** is a high-performance environment within the Advanced Computational Health Enclave (ACHE). The ACHE is a unique environment with restricted physical and electronic access. All electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) processed or stored at NCSA is done within this environment. The Nightingale Cluster system seeks to expand the ACHE to provide a multi-tenant campus cluster-like environment to meet the needs of researchers who wish to process and store ePHI.
