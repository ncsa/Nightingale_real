Quick Start Guide
==================

This information is for users who are adept at using an HPC system and are only interested in the basic Nightingale workflow.

To access Nightingale, your project's Principal Investigator (PI) should fill out the NCSA Extensible Resource Allocation System (XRAS) form. Someone from the Nightingale project will contact you via email within a few days of filling out this form. See :ref:`access` for more details.

Data stored on Nightingale may contain sensitive, regulated information. While Nightingale is set up to protect this data, users (you) are directly responsible for protecting it. Please read the full :ref:`protected` information before using Nightingale.

You log into Nightingale using an Secure Shell (SSH) client on your local desktop or laptop. See :ref:`node_hostnames` for the node hostnames and step-by-step login instructions.

See :ref:`queues` for the current limits of the Nightingale queues.

Nightingale uses Slurm for job management. For information on how to submit batch jobs and interactive batch jobs, see :ref:`slurm`. :ref:`examples` are also available for reference.

You will not work directly on your groupâ€™s curated project data in the /datasets directory. Instructions on how to transfer data from /datasets to your home, scratch, or projects directory can be found in :ref:`transfer`. If you ever need to transfer data **off of Nightingale**, read and follow the :ref:`protected` guidelines **before** transferring.
