Fees Overview
===============

All fees below are MONTHLY costs for University of Illinois users and their collaborators that have a university funding account number (CFOP). Contact NCSA for rates applied to account numbers residing outside the University of Illinois. Allocation/access cannot be shorter than 4 months. User decisions to terminate allocation/access must be provided 3 months prior to termination date. Costs are the same across all node-types. Rates are reviewed and recalculated biennially to ensure superior infrastructure and services. Billing will occur monthly for the prior month’s allocation/use. License fees for some software may be passed onto the user. 

Interactive Computing Options
-----------------------------
**Option 1:** Per Dedicated Node: $1337.50 per month 

Access to entire dedicated node with the quantity of users dictated by the Principal Investigator. 

**Option 2:** Per User on a Shared Node: $267.50 per month

Access to a node that is shared with up to 5 users from across the system. Security between users is ensured via Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). Users can access the node simultaneously. There is no “speed of service” guarantee, although the powerful nodes should be sufficient for most users. NCSA will consult with users who create a significant high-load on the system – options such as reassigning nodes or requiring additional allocation will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Batch Computing Option
-----------------------------
Per core hour used: $0.027

Billed monthly for prior month’s use. For consistent billing, users have the option to pay for a set threshold of core hours per month, regardless of whether they use all the core hours they anticipated. 

Storage
-----------------------------
Per 1 Terabyte allocated: $10.54 per month 

Database Setup and Management Services
--------------------------------------
Per user as needed: $80.71 per month 

Services to support data storage and sharing/accessing relational databases on the system. Not all projects require this support. 

Options for providing “data as a service” to a broad user-community are available. Contact NCSA for details. 

Consultation and Development Services
-------------------------------------

Per project as needed: cost based on time and materials 

NCSA provides expertise in software development, analytics and computation for a fee that covers staff time and materials.
