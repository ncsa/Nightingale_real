Protected Data
==================================

**Data on Nightingale is LEGALLY PROTECTED.  Do NOT download ANY data without explicit permission.**

Users on Nightingale (you, if you're reading this) will have access to data that has, for instance, specific identifiable 
patient information that is protected by HIPAA Federal Law.  Users are directly responsible for protecting that data.  While 
the data resides on Nightingale, the system mechanisms help protect it.  However, downloading any part of that data, no 
matter how small, removes it from the protective measures of the system.  Downloading data from Nightingale may constitute a 
violation of Federal Law for which you could be prosecuted.  All downloads are  monitored and will be investigated.  If you 
have some need to pull data off of Nightingale that is not  protected, you should submit a ticket detailing what data you need 
to download, and why and how you intend to do that, and wait for an all-clear before you do the download.
