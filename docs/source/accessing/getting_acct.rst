Getting an Account
##################

To access Nightingale, you must first get an NCSA Identity (username and password) and request access from Nightingale 
administrators. Once approved, you will be given instructions on how to be added to NCSA's HIPAA Covered Entity. The four 
steps below explain this process.

**1. Create an NCSA Identity**

Before requesting Nightingale access, you need an NCSA identity. You can skip this step if you already have an NCSA identity. 
If you don’t remember your password, you can reset it on the `NCSA Identity and Access Management webpage <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_.

- **To create an NCSA identity**, go to this `invite link <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity>`_

**Note:** In addition to creating a new account, this process will automatically enroll you into NCSA's Duo multi-factor 
authentication (https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa), which is required to log into Nightingale. (This is not the same as the University of Illnois's Duo.)

**2. Request Nightingale Access**

- **To request Nightingale access**, send an email to  `help+hipaa@ncsa.illinois.edu <mailto:help+hipaa@ncsa.illinois.edu>`_ that includes your NCSA identity, your University UIN, and a brief description of why you want the access. Please attach your training certificate if you completed sensitive, regulated data training less than a year ago (HIPAA, CUI, or otherwise).

**3. Get Added to NCSA's HIPAA Covered Entity**

The University of Illinois’ HIPAA Privacy and Security Directive requires that all members of a covered entity complete HIPAA training on an annual basis and perform endpoint disk encryption of portable devices (like laptops) used to access, process, or store HIPAA sensitive, regulated data. Your email request in Step 2 starts the process of getting added to NCSA's HIPAA Covered Entity required to access Nightingale.

- **To get added to NCSA's HIPAA Covered Entity**, follow the instructions in the automated emails from both HIPAA Tools in Savannah and JIRA you will recieve in response to the email you sent in Step 2. These instructions will include information on accessing the HIPAA training, submitting your completion certificate, and performing disk encryption. (The instructions will connect you with NCSA personnel, who will guide you through the encryption process.)

**Note:** You may request an exemption from the encryption requirement in cases such as if you plan to use an on-site work desktop.

**4. Get Added to Your Project's LDAP Group**

After completing Steps 1 - 3, NCSA will add you to your project’s LDAP group, giving you access to the system. If the group doesn’t exist yet, it can take a few days to create it.
