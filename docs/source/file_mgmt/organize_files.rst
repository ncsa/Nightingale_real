Organizing Files
#################

How you organize your files depends somewhat on how the directory structure is set up on your cluster and possibly guidelines set up by your project 
manager. However, there are some basic goals you should keep in mind.

- File names should be logical so that you can find them a week from now, a month from now, and a year from now. Data that cannot be found later is 
not worth nearly    as much as data you can quickly locate. When storing your files to an archive, organize them with this goal in mind so they are 
stored logically and can be accessed easily. 
 
- Use Tar, Winzip, or similar file-bundling software to create a single file from a directory tree, and then store that file. The name of that bundled 
file should clearly indicate what files are bundled within.
 
- In an archival storage site, apply meaningful names to files and directories so you or your colleagues can navigate back to the data when needed. 
It is up to you to decide what works best.
