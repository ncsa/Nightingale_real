Log in to Nightingale
==========================

After you have an :ref:`account on Nightingale <allocations>`, log in to the system using an SSH (Secure Shell) client on your local desktop or laptop. 
Because of the added security for Nightingale, you will first log in to Nightingale's secure node and then log in to a general access login node or, for groups that have them, a specialized interactive node.

.. _node_hostnames:

Node Hostnames
----------------

Secure Node Hostname
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: terminal

   ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu 

General Access Login Nodes Hostnames
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: terminal

   ng-login01.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu
   ng-login02.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu

Specialized Interactive Node Hostname
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: terminal

   NODENAME.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu

``NODENAME`` will be something of the form ``ng-ai22``, ``ng-gpu-h35``, or ``ng-gpu-m37``. 

.. note::

   - Your PI can tell you if your allocation has a specialized interactive node and if so, its hostname.
   - All Nightingale users have access to the general access login nodes (ng-login01 and ng-login02). These nodes are a shared resource for all system users, limit your use of them to editing, compiling, and building your programs.

General Log in Process
------------------------

To log in to Nightingale, establish an SSH connection to the secure node and then establish an SSH connection to your login or interactive node. These are the steps:

#. If you are not on campus, connect to the University of Illinois VPN or NCSA VPN (see :ref:`access_vpn`).
#. ``ssh`` to the secure node ``ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu``. (Replace ``<your_username>`` with your NCSA identity username.)
   
   .. code-block:: terminal

      ssh <your_username>@ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu

#. Enter your NCSA username and password. Note, the terminal will *not* show your password (or placeholder symbols such as asterisks [*]) as you type.
#. Enter ``1`` to send a push to the NCSA Duo app on your phone.
#. Approve the push request on your phone.

   After you approve the push, you will be at a prompt on the ``ngale-bastion-1`` node that will look similar to:
   
   .. code-block:: terminal

      [<your_username>@ngale-bastion-1 ~]$

#. ``ssh`` to your login or interactive node using the appropriate :ref:`hostname <node_hostnames>`, following this syntax:
   
   .. code-block:: terminal

      ssh <your_username>@ng-<node_name>

   For example, this is the command for a user with the username ``hirop`` and the node name ``CPU03``:
   
   .. code-block:: terminal

      ssh hirop@ng-CPU03

Jump Host Log in Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can combine the secure and login node ``ssh`` commands into one by specifying the bastion host as a *jump host*. The jump host is used to connect to your destination node without needing to execute the ``ssh`` command twice. 

.. code-block:: terminal

   ssh -J <your_username>@ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu <your_username>@ng-<login_node>

For example, user ``test1`` can log in to the Nightingale login node ``astro07`` with the following command:
   
.. code-block:: terminal

   ssh -J test1@ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu test1@ng-astro07

Command-line SSH Clients
--------------------------

SSH is a client-server architecture that provides a secure channel over an unsecured network. An SSH client is a program for securely logging in to and executing commands on a remote machine. SSH encrypts the data sent over an open network, such as the internet, so that it can't be read by others.

Several SSH clients are available for accessing Nightingale. The client you use will depend on your workstationâ€™s operating system.

Microsoft Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the built-in SSH Client in Windows (version 10 and later) or select from several freely available third-party SSH clients. 
Third-party clients typically provide a graphical user interface (GUI) rather than a command-line interface. `PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ is a popular choice; `MobaXterm <http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`_ is another one.

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~~

Mac OS X comes with a built-in open-source version of SSH called OpenSSH; access it via the Terminal application. 
`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ is also available for Mac OS X.

Linux
~~~~~~~

Linux has SSH built into it, use the Linux terminal application to connect via SSH. 
`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ is also available for Linux.

.. _access_vpn:

Access Nightingale using a VPN
-----------------------------------

.. note::

   If your login freezes when you try to log in to Nightingale, this may be your problem. Please try one of these VPN methods.  

To access Nightingale off campus, you first need to set up and activate either the University of Illinois VPN or the NCSA VPN.

If you log in to Nightingale from the University of Illinois campus, you don't need to use a VPN. 

University of Illinois VPN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are a member of the University of Illinois, you can use the `University of Illinois VPN service <https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/98773>`_.  You will authenticate to the VPN service itself using your University NetID, password, and two-factor authentication (2FA).  

NCSA VPN
~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have a University of Illinois NetID, you will need to use the `NCSA VPN <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/NetEng/Virtual+Private+Network+%28VPN%29+Service>`_.  

Connect with Terminal, SSH, and XQuartz (for Mac OS users)
------------------------------------------------------------

One-time X Window Software Install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use an application from Nightingale and have its windows on your own computer, before you log in, `download and install XQuartz <https://www.xquartz.org/>`_. Most Nightingale users will want to do this.  

One-time SSH Configuration 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Open the **Terminal** application on your Mac. 

#. Enter the following command into the terminal:

   .. code-block:: terminal

      cd ~/.ssh 

#. Enter the following command into the terminal:

   .. code-block:: terminal

      nano config

   This will bring you into an editor program that looks like this:

   .. code-block:: terminal

       UW PICO 5.09                            File: config                               







       ^G Get Help   ^O WriteOut   ^R Read File  ^Y Prev Pg    ^K Cut Text   ^C Cur Pos    
       ^X Exit       ^J Justify    ^W Where is   ^V Next Pg    ^U UnCut Text ^T To Spell   

   This editor allows you to edit a configuration file that sets up connections to the outside world, so you don't have to type as much all the time. 

#. Copy and paste the following configuration file code block into your terminal. Before you run it, you will modify the code in the next steps. 

   .. code-block:: terminal

      Host ngb1
        HostName ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu
        ControlMaster auto
        ControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r
        ControlPersist 5h
        User YOUR_USERNAME

      Host ng-login01
        HostName ng-login01.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu
        ProxyJump ngb1
        User YOUR_USERNAME

#. Use the arrow keys to position your cursor and make the following modifications:

   a. Replace ``YOUR_USERNAME`` with your NCSA identity username. 

   b. If you have an interactive node assigned to you, you can add second copy of the last stanza of the configuration file; in that stanza, replace ``ng-login01`` with the name of your interactive node.  

   For example, a user with username ``hirop`` and the assigned interactive node ``ng-gpu-x07`` would have the following configuration file:  

   .. code-block:: terminal

      Host ngb1
        HostName ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu
        ControlMaster auto
        ControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r
        ControlPersist 5h
        User hirop

      Host ng-login01
        HostName ng-login01.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu
        ProxyJump ngb1
        User hirop
      
      Host ng-gpu-x07
        HostName ng-gpu-x07.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu
        ProxyJump ngb1
        User hirop
      
#. After you finish modifying the file, press **Control+O** to write the file.

#. Press **return** (or **Enter**) to confirm the file name. 

#. Press **Control+X** to exit the editor and you are back at the prompt.  
      
Log in to Nightingale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      
After the preceding one-time steps are complete, follow these steps each time you want to log in to Nightingale:

#. Enter the following into the terminal (if you are logging in to an interactive node, replace ``ng-login01`` with the name of that interactive node):

   .. code-block:: terminal

      ssh -X ng-login01

   If you see a message that begins "The authenticity of host...." and ends with "Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?", enter ``yes``.  

#. Enter your NCSA (Kerberos) password at the prompt. Note, the terminal will *not* show your password (or placeholder symbols such as asterisks [*]) as you type.  

#. There will be a Duo prompt asking for a passcode or for "option 1". You may either:

   - Enter ``1`` and approve the Duo push notification on your phone.
   
   Or 

   - Enter a 6-digit passcode from the **NCSA** entry of your Duo app.  

#. Again, enter your NCSA (Kerberos) password at the prompt. Note, the terminal will *not* show your password (or placeholder symbols such as asterisks [*]) as you type.  

#. You should have a prompt that reflects that you are on a Nightingale node. It will include ``@ng-`` and look similar to this example for user ``hirop`` on node ``ng-gpu-m01``: 

   .. code-block:: terminal

      [hirop@ng-gpu-m01 ~] $

   You can load modules, run software, and access your files from here.  

Connect with MobaXterm (for Windows users)
--------------------------------------------

You can install `MobaXterm <https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`_ on your workstation and use it to connect to Nightingale nodes using SSH. 
MobaXterm enables an SSH connection and provides other useful utilities, such as file transfer and editing.

Use the following steps to install MobaXterm and connect to Nightingale. Nightingale has extra security to protect the data stored on it, so configuring this connection is slightly different than other HPC clusters. The difference involves adding the SSH connection to the secure bastion node; this is described in Steps 5 and 6 of the one-time setup instructions.

One-time Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

#. `Download and install MobaXterm <https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html>`_. 

   You can install either the Portable or Installer edition of MobaXterm. You will need to have admin privileges on your machine to install the Installer edition. 
   The Portable edition does not require admin privileges, to use it **extract** the downloaded zip file and click **mobaxterm.exe**.

#. Launch the MobaXterm application and click **Session** in the upper left to start an SSH session.

   .. figure:: images/accessing/mobaxterm-terminal-session.png

      :alt: MobaXterm Session window with showing Network settings tab clicked and SSH gateway jump host button highlighted.
      :width: 750

#. In the **jump hosts configuration** window:

   a. In the **Gateway host** box, enter ``ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu``. 

   b. In the **Username** box, enter your NCSA identity username. 

   c. Click **OK**. 

   You may see a warning message saying that your remote host identification has changed; click **Yes** to continue.

   .. figure:: images/accessing/mobaxterm-jump-host-config.png
      :alt: MobaXterm Session window with showing values for the SSH gateway jump host filled in.
      :width: 600

#. You should now be back in the **Session settings** window. Click **OK** to initiate your SSH connection. 

#. A terminal window will be displayed asking for your password; enter your NCSA (Kerberos) password and press **Enter**.

Log in to Nightingale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the preceding one-time setup is complete, follow these steps each time you want to log in to Nightingale:

#. Open **MobaXterm**. 

#. In the left bar, there is a list of **User sessions**, each one is a node that you have configured for logging in. 

   Right-click on the Nightingale node you want to log in to and select **execute**. 

#. A window will pop up asking for your password. Enter your NCSA (Kerberos) password and press **Enter** or click **OK**.

#. A second window will pop up asking for your 2FA code. 

   a. On your phone, open the **Duo app**.

   b. Select the **NCSA** entry (not the *University of Illinois* entry).

   c. Enter the 6-digit passcode displayed in the Duo app into the pop-up window.  

#. A black window without a prompt will appear. **You may need to wait 30 seconds or a minute here.** 

   When it asks for your password, enter your NCSA (Kerberos) password. Note, the window will *not* show your password (or placeholder symbols such as asterisks [*]) as you type.

#. You are now ready to work. You should have a prompt at the bottom and a file window on the left showing your directories on Nightingale.
