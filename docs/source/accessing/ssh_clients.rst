SSH Clients
===========

SSH (Secure Shell) is an application that gives users a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network. It allows them to log in to another computer over a network, execute commands on that machine, and to move files from one computer to another. SSH provides strong authentication to prevent other from using their account, and it encrypts their data between computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet, so that it can’t be read by others.

Several SSH-based clients are available for accessing Nightingale. Which one you use depends on your workstation’s operating 
system. These are described in the sections below.

**Microsoft Windows**

You can use the built-in SSH Client in Windows (version 10 and above) or select from several freely available third-party SSH 
clients when using the Microsoft Windows operating system. These typically provide a Graphical User Interface rather than a 
command-line interface. `PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ is a popular choice, and
`MobaXterm <http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/>`_ is another one.

**Mac OS X**

Mac OS X comes with a built-in open-source version of SSH called OpenSSH. You can access it via the Terminal application. 
`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ is also available for Mac OS X.

**Linux**

The Linux operating system has SSH built into it. You use the Linux terminal application to connect via SSH. 
`PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>`_ is also available for Linux.
