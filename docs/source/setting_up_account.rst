Setting Up Your Account
==============================================

The steps below explain how to request Nightingale access and start
using the cluster.

#. Creating NCSA Identity

   -  Before requesting Nightingale access, you need to have an NCSA
      identity. You can generate your NCSA identity by using this invite
      link:https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity.
   -  In addition to creating a new account, this process will
      automatically enroll you into NCSA's Duo multi-factor
      authentication (https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa) which is
      required to log into Nightingale.
   -  You can skip this step if you already have an NCSA identity. If
      you don’t remember your password, you can reset it by using this
      link:https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/.
   -  **VERY IMPORTANT:** You should always have **TWO backup Duo
      tokens** (these are 8-digit numbers that you write down manually
      and store somewhere OTHER THAN ON YOUR PHONE). You can use these
      codes to verify your identity in case you upgrade your phone
      without the ability to get a duo code from your old phone, or
      perhaps lose your phone. If you don't have two codes written down
      somewhere you can get at them, please use the Duo system to
      generate them.

#. Requesting Nightingale Access

   -  To request Nightingale access, send an email to Maria Jaromin
      at\ mjaromin@illinois.edu. The request should include your NCSA
      username, your University UIN, and a brief justification why you
      need the access.
   -  If you completed the University of Illinois’ HIPAA privacy and
      security training less than a year ago, please attach your
      training certificate.

   Entity <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/ACHE/HIPAA+Tools%3A+Adding+a+HIPAA+Covered+Entity>`__

   -  The email request in Step 2 starts the process of adding you to
      NCSA's "HIPAA Covered Entity". The University of Illinois’ HIPAA
      Privacy and Security Directive requires that all members of a
      covered component complete the HIPAA training on an annual basis
      *and perform endpoint disk encryption of portable devices (like
      laptops) used to access, process or store ePHI.*

      #. HIPAA training

         #. University of Illinois currently uses
            the\ `KnowBe4 <https://training.knowbe4.com/auth/saml/ef047fafa8535>`__\ platform
            to deploy the HIPAA training. You will be added to the
            training and will receive an email with instructions on
            access the platform.
         #. After completing the training, you need to upload the
            training certificate to\ `HIPAA
            Tools <https://internal.ncsa.illinois.edu/mis/hipaa/training/index.php?page=main&>`__\ in
            Savannah.

         #. It is expected that the platform will change in the future.

      #. Full disk encryption

         #. It is expected that the campus software will change in the
            future.
         #. If you plan to use an on-site work desktop, you can request
            an exemption from the encryption requirement.
