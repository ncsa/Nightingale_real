When installing any software you should consider the following:

 - Home directory disk usage quotas.
 - Will the software be used by multiple users in my group?
   (Project space is the **recommended** location to install software.)
 - Does the desired software have dependencies/requirements?
 - Is the prerequisite software already installed?
