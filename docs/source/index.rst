**Nightingale** is a high-performance compute cluster for sensitive data. It offers researchers a secure system for data storage and powerful computation. NCSA experts manage the complex requirements surrounding sensitive data, taking the burden off the user so they can focus on their research. The system is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy and security rules for using Protected Health Information (PHI). Nightingale is not limited to the health domain and accommodates projects that require this amount of security or less, such as compliance with Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) policies. It resides in the NCSA National Petascale Facility and is audited yearly by an outside entity to ensure secure operation (SOC 2, Type 2). It is available for a fee to University of Illinois faculty, staff, students and their collaborators through desktop access and encrypted laptop access. Rates are based on a service model that provides flexibility for both short-term and long-term projects. If this level of security is not needed, consider other
