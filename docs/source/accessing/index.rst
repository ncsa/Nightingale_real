Accessing the System
=========================

Getting an Account
-------------------

To access Nightingale, your project needs to have a "project group" set up with access to Nightingale, and associated with the various resources that you need to use.  The project's Principle Investigator ("PI") sets up the project group, and the PI's user login account will be the first login accout attached to the project group.  The PI must have an NCSA Identity 
(username and password) or get one, and request access from Nightingale administrators.  This page covers that process.  The project PI will need to follow the process of creating the project group, and themselves go through the training process and be added to the HIPAA Covered Entity.  Other users on the project will just need to follow the training and Covered Entity process.  This page covers both processes.  

Create an NCSA Identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before requesting Nightingale access, both PIs and individual users need an NCSA identity. You can skip this step if you already have an NCSA identity. 
If you donâ€™t remember your password, you can reset it on the `NCSA Identity and Access Management webpage <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_.

- **To create an NCSA identity**, go to this `invite link <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity>`_

**Note:** In addition to creating a new account, this process will automatically enroll you into NCSA's Duo multi-factor 
authentication (https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa), which is required to log into Nightingale. (This is not the same as the University of Illnois's Duo.).  When you enroll in NCSA Duo, it's **very important** create and save two backup codes to use in case you lose your Duo device.  

Discuss Your Project With Nightingale Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Individual users don't need to follow this step.).  Before getting your project added to the Nightingale system, a PI will need to discuss your project, its needs, your expectations, and what Nightingale access can get you.  To begin that conversation, please fill out `the NCSA XRAS <https://xras-submit.ncsa.illinois.edu/opportunities/531957/requests/new>`_.  Someone from the Nightingale project will contact you via email within a few days of filling out this form.  That person will begin the process of creating your project group.  

After your project group is created, Nightingale adminstirators will create your data storage directories and project group name.  The PI will find out about these steps via email.  Your group will be assigned an interactive node (shared or exclusive) to log into, and/or if you have batch system access, you will be assigned a "charge account" to assign your jobs to.  

Being Added to Nightingale Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both PIs creating a new project and individual users joining a project will need to follow these steps to get their user login accounts access to the Nightingale system.  

During that process, *you* will be responsible for:

* Becoming part of the NCSA HIPAA Covered Entity

  * this will involve taking training specific to the type of data that you'll be handling on Nightingale
  
  * you may need to submit your training certificate to a web form to become part of the covered entity

* Making sure all devices that you will log into Nightingale from have an encrypted hard drive
