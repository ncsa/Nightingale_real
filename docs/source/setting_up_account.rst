Setting Up Your Account

The steps below explain how to request Nightingale access and start
using the cluster.

#. Creating NCSA Identity

   -  Before requesting Nightingale access, you need to have an NCSA
      identity. You can generate your NCSA identity by using this invite
      link:https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity.
   -  In addition to creating a new account, this process will
      automatically enroll you into NCSA's Duo multi-factor
      authentication (https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa) which is
      required to log into Nightingale.
   -  **VERY IMPORTANT:** You should always have **TWO backup Duo
      tokens** (these are 8-digit numbers that you write down manually
      and store somewhere OTHER THAN ON YOUR PHONE). You can use these
      codes to verify your identity in case you replace or lose your phone. 
      If you don't have two codes, see step #5 of "Enrollment Steps" on the 
      `Duo at NCSA wiki page <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/cybersec/Duo+at+NCSA>`_.  
   -  You can skip this step if you already have an NCSA identity. If
      you donâ€™t remember your password, you can reset it by using this
      link:https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/.

   In the future, this next step ("requesting nightingale access") will need to refer to XRAS.  Something like: 
   If you are a project PI, you can submit an allocation request by using the Resource Allocation System (XRAS). https://xras-submit.ncsa.illinois.edu/login

#. Requesting Nightingale Access

   -  To request Nightingale access, send an email to Maria Jaromin
      at\ mjaromin@illinois.edu. The request should include your NCSA
      username, your University UIN, and a brief justification why you
      need the access.
   -  If you completed some type of Regulated Sensitive Data training less than a year ago (HIPPA or otherwise), please attach your
      training certificate.

#. `Getting Added to NCSA Covered
   Entity <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/ACHE/HIPAA+Tools%3A+Adding+a+HIPAA+Covered+Entity>`__

   -  You are required to receive training on handling the type of Regulated Sensitive Data that you will be working with on Nighingale every year, whether that be EPHI or CUI or other.  

      #. Regulated Sensitive Data training

         #. After being added to the system but before you can use it, you will need to complete training that corresponds to the *type* of regulated sensitive data you will be accessing.  You will be emailed instructions how to take this training.  You will generally need to save a completion certificate at the end of the training course.  
         #. After completing the training, you need to upload the
            training certificate to\ `HIPAA
            Tools <https://internal.ncsa.illinois.edu/mis/hipaa/training/index.php?page=main&>`__\ in
            Savannah.

         #. The training platform may change from year to year.  

      #. Full disk encryption

         #. You will be contacted by NCSA personnel to get your computer set up with full-disk encryption.  That person will guide you through the steps to secure your hard drive.  
         #. If you plan to use an on-site work desktop, you can request
            an exemption from the encryption requirement.
