========================
Logging Onto Nightingale
========================

Once you have completed the steps described in Getting Access to Nightingale, you can log onto Nightingale's login nodes using SSH (Secure Shell). 

If your allocation doesn't have an assigned node, you will log into one
of the general login nodes using one of the following hostnames:

-  ng-login01.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu
-  ng-login02.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu

If your allocation does have an assigned node, your login node's hostname will be
similar to:

- <ng-yourgroup01>.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu

where <ng-yourgroup01> is the name of your allocation group. You will be informed if your allocation has an assigned node.

Once you are added to the NCSA Covered Entity and your account is added to the appropriate access group, you can log onto
Nightingale by following these steps:

- If not on campus, connect to the campus VPN
- SSH to your login node using the appropriate hostname (see above)
- Enter your NCSA username and password
- Enter '1' to send a push to the Duo app on your smartphone
- Approve the request on your phone
- ssh to 'ngale01'
