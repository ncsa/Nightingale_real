Project Groups and User Accounts
====================================

To access Nightingale, a project needs to have a project group (allocation) set up on the system. 
You must be the project's **Principal Investigator (PI)** to set up the project group. If you are *not* a project PI and want to be added to an existing Nightingale project group, jump to :ref:`get-added`.

Set Up a Project Group (for PIs)
--------------------------------

As the PI, your user login account will be the first login account attached to the project group on Nightingale. You will need to follow the process to create the project group, complete the training process, and be added to the HIPAA Covered Entity. Other users on the project will only need to complete the training and Covered Entity processes.

Create an NCSA Identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you request a project group on Nightingale, you must have an NCSA Identity. 

To create an NCSA identity, go to this `Nightingale invite <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity>`_ and click **Register New User and Join**.  
This process will also automatically enroll you in `NCSA's Duo multi-factor authentication <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa>`_, which is required to log in to Nightingale. This is separate from the University of Illinois Duo. 

.. note::
   When you enroll in NCSA Duo, it is important to create and save two backup codes in case you lose your Duo device.  
   
If you already have an NCSA identity but can't remember your password, you can reset it at `NCSA Identity and Access Management <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_.

Discuss Your Project with Nightingale Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before your project group is created on Nightingale, you will discuss your project, its needs, your expectations, and what Nightingale access can get you with the Nightingale team. 

To begin that conversation, please fill out and the `NCSA XRAS form <https://xras-submit.ncsa.illinois.edu/opportunities/531957/requests/new>`_. (Log in with your NCSA identity username and password.) 

Within a few days, someone from the Nightingale team will contact you, via email, to begin the process of creating your project group.  

After your Project Group is Created
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After your project group is created, Nightingale administrators will create your data storage directories and project group name. These will be communicated via email. Your group will be assigned an *interactive node* (shared or exclusive) to log in to and/or if you have batch system access, you will be assigned a *charge account* to assign your jobs to.  

Get a User Login Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get a user login account to access the Nightingale system, it is *your* responsibility to:

  - Become part of the NCSA HIPAA Covered Entity. This will involve taking training specific to the type of data that you will be handling on Nightingale. You may need to submit your training certificate to a web form to become part of the covered entity.

  - Make sure all devices that you will log in to Nightingale from have an encrypted hard drive.

See the `NCSA Allocation and Account Management documentation page <https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/USSPPRT/NCSA+Allocation+and+Account+Management>`_ for more information.
