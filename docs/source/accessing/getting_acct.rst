Getting an Account
====================

To access Nightingale, your project needs to have a project group on the machine, you must get an NCSA Identity 
(username and password), and request access from Nightingale administrators. 
Once approved, you will be given instructions on how to be added to NCSA's HIPAA Covered Entity. 
The steps below explain this process.

Create an NCSA Identity
----------------------------

Before requesting Nightingale access, you need an NCSA identity. You can skip this step if you already have an NCSA identity. 
If you donâ€™t remember your password, you can reset it on the `NCSA Identity and Access Management webpage <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_.

- **To create an NCSA identity**, go to this `invite link <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity>`_

**Note:** In addition to creating a new account, this process will automatically enroll you into NCSA's Duo multi-factor 
authentication (https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa), which is required to log into Nightingale. (This is not the same as the University of Illnois's Duo.).  When you enroll in NCSA Duo, it's **very important** create and save two backup codes to use in case you lose your Duo device.  

Discuss Your Project With Nightingale Management
----------------------------------------------------

Before getting your project added to the Nightingale system, you will need to discuss your project, its needs, your expectations, and what Nightingale access can get you.  To begin that conversation, please fill out `the NCSA XRAS <https://xras-submit.ncsa.illinois.edu/opportunities/531957/requests/new>`_.  Someone from the Nightingale project will contact you via email within a few days of filling out this form.  That person will begin the process of creating your project group.  

During that process, *you* will be responsible for:

* Becoming part of the NCSA HIPAA Covered Entity

  * this will involve taking training specific to the type of data that you'll be handling on Nightingale
  
  * you may need to submit your training certificate to a web form to become part of the covered entity

* Making sure all devices that you will log into Nightingale from have an encrypted hard drive

The following will be happening on Nightingale on your behalf 

* Your project group will be created

* your project may be assigned a node or part of a node (interactive node access)

* your project may be granted access to the batch computing system (batch system access)
