X Window Servers
==================

Originally developed for UNIX, the X Window System allows a program on one computer to open windows on another computerâ€™s screen (usually your desktop/laptop computer). 
The program that runs on the Nightingale is called the *client*. 
The program that runs on your desktop computer is called the *server*. 
X Window servers are available for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac, and UNIX/Linux.
