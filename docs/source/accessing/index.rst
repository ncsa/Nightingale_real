Accessing the System
=========================

Getting an Account
-------------------

To access Nightingale, your project needs to have a "project group" set up with access to Nightingale, and associated with the various resources that you need to use.  The project's Principle Investigator ("PI") sets up the project group, and the PI's user login account will be the first login accout attached to the project group.  The PI must have an NCSA Identity 
(username and password) or get one, and request access from Nightingale administrators.  This page covers that process.  The project PI will need to follow the process of creating the project group, and themselves go through the training process and be added to the HIPAA Covered Entity.  Other users on the project will just need to follow the training and Covered Entity process.  This page covers both processes.  

Create an NCSA Identity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before requesting Nightingale access, both PIs and individual users need an NCSA identity. You can skip this step if you already have an NCSA identity. 
If you donâ€™t remember your password, you can reset it on the `NCSA Identity and Access Management webpage <https://identity.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_.

- **To create an NCSA identity**, go to this `invite link <https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/ngale_identity>`_

**Note:** In addition to creating a new account, this process will automatically enroll you into NCSA's Duo multi-factor 
authentication (https://go.ncsa.illinois.edu/2fa), which is required to log into Nightingale. (This is not the same as the University of Illnois's Duo.).  When you enroll in NCSA Duo, it's **very important** create and save two backup codes to use in case you lose your Duo device.  

Discuss Your Project With Nightingale Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Individual users don't need to follow this step.).  Before getting your project added to the Nightingale system, a PI will need to discuss your project, its needs, your expectations, and what Nightingale access can get you.  To begin that conversation, please fill out `the NCSA XRAS <https://xras-submit.ncsa.illinois.edu/opportunities/531957/requests/new>`_.  Someone from the Nightingale project will contact you via email within a few days of filling out this form.  That person will begin the process of creating your project group.  

After your project group is created, Nightingale adminstirators will create your data storage directories and project group name.  The PI will find out about these steps via email.  Your group will be assigned an interactive node (shared or exclusive) to log into, and/or if you have batch system access, you will be assigned a "charge account" to assign your jobs to.  

Being Added to Nightingale Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both PIs creating a new project and individual users joining a project will need to follow these steps to get their user login accounts access to the Nightingale system.  

During that process, *you* will be responsible for:

* Becoming part of the NCSA HIPAA Covered Entity

  * this will involve taking training specific to the type of data that you'll be handling on Nightingale
  
  * you may need to submit your training certificate to a web form to become part of the covered entity

* Making sure all devices that you will log into Nightingale from have an encrypted hard drive

Logging Onto Nightingale
--------------------------

Once you have obtained an account on Nightingale, you can log on using an SSH (Secure Shell) client on your local desktop or laptop. 
Because of the added security for Nightingale, you will first log onto Nightingale's secure node and then log onto a general access login node 
or, for groups that have them, a specialized interactive node. The hostnames for these login nodes are listed below.

**Secure Node Hostname**::

   ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu 

**General Access Login Nodes Hostnames**::

   ng-login01.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu
   ng-login02.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu

**Specialized Interactive Node Hostname**::

   ng-<yourgroup>01.ngale.internal.ncsa.edu

where ng-<yourgroup>01 is the name of your allocation group. 

**Notes:** 

- Your principal investigator can inform you if your allocation has a specialized interactive node and its hostname.
- All Nightingale users have access to the general access login nodes. Please be aware that these nodes are a shared resource for all 
  system users, and you should limit your use of them to editing, compiling, and building your programs.

**General Log in Process**

You can log onto Nightingale by following these steps:

1. If not on campus, connect to the campus VPN. (`Instructions for installing the campus VPN <https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/98773>`_)
2. SSH to the secure node ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu.
3. Enter your NCSA username and password. (you will not see the characters you type for your password)
4. Enter '1' to send a push to the **NCSA Duo** app on your smartphone.
5. Approve the request on your phone.
6. SSH to your login node using the appropriate hostname (see above).

Below is a sample SSH command line to log into Nightingale's secure node where <username> is the username you created for your NCSA identity.::

   ssh <username>@ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu

After entering the ssh command, you will be prompted to enter your password, followed by a prompt to send a push to the Duo app (both of which you will not see on the screen). After you have approved the push, you will be at a prompt on ngale-bastion-1 node that will look similar to::

   [csteffen@ngale-bastion-1 ~]$

At the prompt, enter an SSH command using the hostname of your login node following this syntax:: 

   ssh <your_username>@ng-<yourgroup>01
   
For example, if your username is "hirop" and you group name is "biology" then your ssh command would look like this:: 

   ssh hirop@ng-biology03
   
In this case, you would been specifically told that "ng-biology03" would be your node to use for your computations.

The two commands above can be combined into one by specifying the bastion host as a "jump" host. The jump host is used to connect you to your destination node without you needing to interact with it. In this example, user "test1" can log into the Nightingale login node "login01" directly without logging into the bastion host first.::

   ssh -J test1@ngale-bastion-1.ncsa.illinois.edu test1@ng-login01
