File Systems
=============================

Nightingale has a parallel files system, where both your user's home directory and your project's shared space live.  


Nightingale is architected specifically to keep data protected both from people outside Nightingale and other Nightingale users.  Unlike other systems, we do not look at user data because we assume that any of your data could be HIPAA-covered information.  

Because of this compartmentalization, typically, you will already know where your data is located on Nightingale, because where that data lives will be part of the conversation between our staff and getting your team onto the system.  So if you're a Nightingale user and you don't know where your data lives, you should talk to your PI ("Principal Investigator") (that is, the person on your end, often your supervisor, who requested your user account).  If you are the project PI, or your PI doesn't know where the data is, then one of you should send in a ticket and ask, and we'll help you.  

If your data lives on a file system, it will likely be somewhere like /projects/sciteam/XXXX/ where "XXXX" will actually be a string of characters that correspond to your project.  You and the other users of your project will be able to see into that space and write data there, but other users, including staff, will not be able to see into it unless special measures are taken. 

Your data may also live on a database on a dedicated internal server.  If that's the case, you'll presumably know that, and have all the access information.  If not, or if the database isn't working for some reason, or you're having a problem, as always, submit a ticket.
